x to exit.
?N to examine any chunk. N is its real address, which is the value returned by newvec minus two.
vf to freevec the variable named v. Variable names are single lower-case letters.
v? to see the value of variable v.
vnN to newvec(N), N is number of words wanted, v is the variable in which the returned value will be stored,
                  the response is v = A, where A is the pointer returned by newvec.
